This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r import data & package}
library(lavaan)
data(HolzingerSwineford1939, package = "lavaan")
head(HolzingerSwineford1939)
```
```{r structure model}
HS.model <- "visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3 # construct model
               textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
               speed =~ x7 + x8 + x9"
fit <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939) #设置参数
parTable(fit)
summary(fit, fit.measures = TRUE)
```
```{r SEM practice}
library(lavaan)
data(PoliticalDemocracy, package = "lavaan")
head(PoliticalDemocracy)
```
```{r model construction}
model <- "# measurement model
     ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
     dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
     dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8
     # regressions
     dem60 ~ ind60
     dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60
     # residual covariances
     y1 ~~ y5
     y2 ~~ y4 + y6
     y3 ~~ y7
     y4 ~~ y8
     y6 ~~ y8"
fit <- sem(model, data = PoliticalDemocracy)
summary(fit, standardized = TRUE)
coef(fit) #返回自由参数估计值及标签
inspect(fit) #模型内部的LISREL矩阵表示  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
